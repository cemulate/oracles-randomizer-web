# Static Web App Stack

A minimal front-end web application using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

To try it out, clone the repo and run

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

# Extras

The `master` branch is a fairly barebones web app skeleton.
Commonly, you may want more:

## Vue

The `with-vue` branch includes a basic setup of Vue

## PWA Support

The `with-pwa-support` (based on `with-vue`) includes basic PWA support (service workers w/ workbox caching setup, a manifest and icons)
